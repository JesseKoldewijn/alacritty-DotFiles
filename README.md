# Notes

-   There is a starship prompt config included under the "plugins" directory. Eventhough starship does run on windows I would not recommend it on cmd due to weird spacing in the prompt.

-   Clink injection flow for windows is added as well as a windows commands work-around (more Unix/Linux like commands flow)
